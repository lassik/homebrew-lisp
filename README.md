# Homebrew Lisp

This is a Homebrew tap for the Lisp programming language family.
Several Lisp implementations are packaged in Homebrew core. This tap
is for lesser-known implementations and other tools that are still fun
to have.

What's on topic? Essentially any language based on S-expressions.
Common Lisp, Scheme, Clojure, Emacs Lisp, ISLisp, etc.

## How do I install these formulae?

Or `brew tap lassik/lisp` and then `brew install <formula>`.
